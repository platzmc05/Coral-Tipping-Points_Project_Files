## Introduction:

Urban coastal areas face powerful push-pull factors for investment into critical infrastructures, institutions, and information systems that may soon be stranded assets as rising sea level, anthropogenic changes in water temperature and quality, and altered hydrologic flows render areas economically unproductive or uninhabitable. South Florida, and the Florida Reef Tract specifically, illustrates the tipping point of humanity’s struggle between the burgeoning coastal population and economic development, and the threats to the coastal ecosystems it depends upon. The coral die-offs are evidence that a tipping point in the system has been reached, and the health of the system is in peril. There remain critical opportunities to integrate understanding of the ecosystem within its socio-economic context as a means to understand how this context can amplify the locations and impacts of coral decline, and how die-off events may ripple through human communities and economic sectors

By linking discourse, socioeconomic, and biophysical datasets, this project explores connections between social-ecological components of the Florida Reef Tract system to identify economic and social impacts surrounding the recent Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease (SCTLD) event. Since 2014, SCTLD has been ravaging the Florida Reef Tract and spreading throughout the Western Atlantic. Since first appearing near the Port of Miami in 2014, the disease has spread the entire length of the Florida Reef Tract as well as throughout the Western Atlantic to the reefs of 17 countries and territories. SCTLD affects nearly half of the 45 reef building stony coral species and results in complete colony mortality just days to weeks following infection. Recent studies in the Florida Reef Tract approximate that average coral cover has fallen from a historical level of 25-40% to just 2% coral cover presently as a results of these disease and anthropogenic impacts.

## Research Objective:

We seek to advance the understanding of socio-ecological tipping points in a complex system, as information about coral decline flows from the coral reef itself, to (human) individuals who perceive the decline, and then to the broader (human) community and potential visitors through communication channels (discourse), ultimately causing behavioral changes that impact local and regional economies. That is, the stressor of coral decline impacts the ecosystem, and that stress then reverberates through the socio-economic system. Through this investigation, we hope to identify correlations and understand tipping point dynamics to answer research questions such as: what is the lag time between an environmental catastrophe and the social response? This project seeks to build a systematic understanding of linkages between the biological, hydrologic, economic, and socio-cultural components of the socio-ecological system to understand how dynamics in specific components affect the system’s ability to recover from past disturbances.

The objective is to build a data synthesis model that integrates observations from multiple components of the system (ecological, economic, social) and allows statistical analysis of how stimuli (i.e., coral die-off or decline) in one component reverberates across other components of the socio-ecological system.  The statistical analysis will focus on how stimuli reverberate through the system across both space and time. We have identified various datasets in the ecological, economic, and social domains.   

## Ecological Data: 

For the ecological component, including the physical environment as well as status of the coral reef tract itself, there are a number of datasets available of which we have identified and explored approximately 20. These include reef status reports, biological survey data, bathymetry, sea surface temperature, bleaching reports, and ocean acidification data, among others. For this study, we have selected the following datasets: 

- Coral disease: prevalence percentages and boundary 
- Stony coral species richness  
- Reef benthic composition 
- Major storm events 
- Water temperature 
- Degree heating weeks  
- Reef fish density and diversity

Increasing sea temperatures are known to cause coral stress and make them more susceptible to threats such as disease. Degree heating weeks (DHW) are a measure of how much heat stress has accumulated in a region over a period of 3 months, and are a metric that is used to predict mass bleaching events. A plot of average monthly regional sea surface temperature (SST) and degree heating weeks shows that SST is rising over the period 2012 - 2020 and the frequency of DHW has increased. This information provides important environmental context for the system.

## Economic Data:

In terms of the economic component, there are extensive datasets including county-level sales data for all of Florida, including Monroe county (Florida Keys), comprising over 60 business sub-sectors that can be aggregated into higher level sectors, in addition to hotel and tourism data for the study area. Datasets considered for the economic component also include human dimensions indicators from the Federal Reserve Economic Database and US Census, such as population, household income, unemployment rates, number of SNAP recipients, and labor force, among others. Here we investigate: 

- Monroe County gross sales for 64 economy sectors  
- Monroe County unemployment  
- Monroe County labor force

## Social Discourse Data: 

In regard to the social component, there are several databases available that offer quantitative and qualitative insights. For instance, while databases such as STR for hotel data or annual tourism reports can offer quantitative insights of the changes in tourism, the social media databases complement with qualitative insights on the depth of those changes, capturing a wider range of perceptions including both locals and tourists. Here we explore: 

1) Twitter discourse
