This repository contains data to assess social-ecological tipping points associated with the Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease event in the Florida Reef Tract. Through an assessment of social and ecological datasets, we hope to identify correlations and understand tipping point dynamics to answer research questions such as: what is the lag time between an environmental catastrophe and the social response?

Datasets we intend to utilize include: 
-	Twitter data from 2012-present (time of tweet, 2012-2021)
-	Gross sales for 64 economy sectors from 2012-present (Monroe County level, monthly timescale)
-	Unemployment from 2012-present (Monroe County level, monthly timescale)
-	Labor force from 2012-present (Monroe County level, monthly timescale)
-	Coral disease: prevalence percentages and boundary from 2017 - 2019 (FRT-wide, daily) 
-	Reef benthic composition from 2012-present (FRT-wide, yearly) 
-	Major storm events from 2012-present (FRT-wide, event date) 
-	Water temperature from 2012-present (FRT-wide, daily)
-	Degree heating weeks from 2012-present (FRT-wide, weekly)
-	Commercial fisheries landings from 2012-present (Monroe Couty, annual) 
-	Reef fish density and diversity from 2012-present (FRT-wide, monthly)
