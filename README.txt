Introduction:

Urban coastal areas face powerful push-pull factors for investment into critical infrastructures, institutions, and information systems that may soon be stranded assets as rising sea level, anthropogenic changes in water temperature and quality, and altered hydrologic flows render areas economically unproductive or uninhabitable. South Florida, and the Florida Reef Tract specifically, illustrates the tipping point of humanity’s struggle between the burgeoning coastal population and economic development, and the threats to the coastal ecosystems it depends upon. The coral die-offs are evidence that a tipping point in the system has been reached, and the health of the system is in peril. There remain critical opportunities to integrate understanding of the ecosystem within its socio-economic context as a means to understand how this context can amplify the locations and impacts of coral decline, and how die-off events may ripple through human communities and economic sectors.

By linking discourse, socioeconomic, and biophysical datasets, this project explores connections between socio-ecological components of the Florida Reef Tract system to identify economic and social impacts surrounding the recent Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease (SCTLD) event. Since 2014, SCTLD has been ravaging the Florida Reef Tract and spreading throughout the Western Atlantic. Since first appearing near the Port of Miami in 2014, the disease has spread the entire length of the Florida Reef Tract as well as throughout the Western Atlantic to the reefs of 17 countries and territories. SCTLD affects nearly half of the 45 reef building stony coral species and results in complete colony mortality just days to weeks following infection. Recent studies in the Florida Reef Tract approximate that average coral cover has fallen from a historical level of 25-40% to just 2% coral cover. 

We seek to advance the understanding of socio-ecological tipping points in a complex system, as information about coral decline flows from the coral reef itself, to (human) individuals who perceive the decline, and then to the broader (human) community and potential visitors through communication channels (discourse), ultimately causing behavioral changes that impact local and regional economies. That is, the stressor of coral decline impacts the ecosystem, and that stress then reverberates through the socio-economic system. Through this investigation, we hope to identify correlations and understand tipping point dynamics to answer research questions such as: what is the lag time between an environmental catastrophe and the social response? This project seeks to build a systematic understanding of linkages between the biological, hydrologic, economic, and socio-cultural components of the socio-ecological system to understand how dynamics in specific components affect the system’s ability to recover from past disturbances.
